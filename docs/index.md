A `loadscreen` resource for FiveM, styled with kora_theme's shared tokens so
it matches the rest of the qbcore2 UI out of the box. It sets
`loadscreen_manual_shutdown 'yes'`, so the screen stays up until something
explicitly dismisses it — letting other resources (character selection,
asset streaming, etc.) finish before the player is dropped into the world.

## Requirements

- `kora_theme`
- [kora_lib](https://qbcore2.github.io/kora_lib/)

## Installation

`server.cfg`, in this order:
```
ensure kora_theme
ensure kora_lib
ensure kora_loading
```

## Usage examples

### Dismissing the loading screen (manual shutdown)

Because `loadscreen_manual_shutdown` is on, `client.lua` never calls the
shutdown native itself — ownership is handed to whichever resource knows the
player is actually ready. Call FiveM's native from that resource once it has
what it needs:
```lua
-- client, in whatever resource owns "is the player ready" (e.g. after
-- character data has arrived)
ShutdownLoadingScreen()
```
On a bare server with no such resource installed, `spawnmanager`'s own
`spawnPlayer()` calls `ShutdownLoadingScreen()` as part of its native spawn
sequence, so nothing hangs even without extra setup.

### Setting the server name and loading tips

`config.lua` is a `shared_script`, so edit it directly:
```lua
Config.serverName = 'My Roleplay Server'

Config.tips = {
    'Tip: press F1 to open the phone.',
    'Tip: buy a house to unlock private storage.',
}
```
The page receives these as it opens (handed over by `server.lua` while the
player connects, with the `loadingscreen:getTheme` NUI callback as a late
fallback), then cycles tips every 6 seconds.

### Progress bar

The bar fills from FiveM's own loadscreen events (`loadProgress`, plus the
init-function and map-load events as a fallback) and never moves backwards.
Next to it the page shows the percentage and the current load stage; set
`Config.showProgressText = false` to hide that text and keep only the bar.

### Wallpaper, video and music

Out of the box the screen shows the animated Kora Discord banner. To use your
own, put the files in `html/media/` and list them in `config.lua` (or use a full
`https://` address):
```lua
Config.media = {
    backdrop = true,
    images = { 'media/city.jpg', 'media/beach.jpg' }, -- several = slideshow
    defaultWallpaper = 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/banners/...', -- the Kora banner
    themeWallpaper = true,
    slideSeconds = 8,
    videos = { { video = 'media/intro.webm' }, { video = 'media/city.webm', audio = 'media/theme.ogg' } }, -- back to back; WebM only
    videoSound = true,   -- the videos' own soundtracks (a row's audio replaces it)
    videoOrder = 'shuffle', -- 'sequential', 'shuffle' or 'random'
    videoPinFirst = true, -- first video always plays first, then the order applies to the rest
    videoOverlap = 0,    -- seconds of crossfade between videos; 0 = clean cut
    music = 'media/theme.ogg',
    musicVolume = 0.3,
    dim = 0.45,          -- darkens the wallpaper so text stays readable
}
```
A wallpaper may be **any still or animated format the browser can paint** —
`.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.avif` — loaded from a local
file or from a CDN. Files in `html/media/` are streamed to the loadscreen
automatically; keep them small, because players see the screen while they are
still downloading your server. A CDN wallpaper costs nothing to download from
the server but needs the player's connection, so it is preloaded: if it fails,
it drops out silently and the themed background shows instead.

Wallpaper sources, most specific first:

1. `Config.media.images` — one wallpaper, or several as a slideshow.
2. `"wallpaper"` in `kora_theme/theme.json` (unless `themeWallpaper = false`) —
   a URL, a list of URLs, or a path to a file kora_theme itself ships. Re-run
   `node tools/sync-theme.mjs` after editing it, like any other theme change.
   A theme-hosted file comes from kora_theme's own NUI origin, which can answer
   a moment late during a loadscreen; a CDN URL or a file in `html/media/`
   appears immediately.
3. `Config.media.defaultWallpaper` — the Kora Discord banner by default. Set it
   to `''` for the themed background and nothing else.

Any configured video, or `backdrop = false`, means no default wallpaper is
fetched at all. `dim` only applies once a wallpaper or video has actually
loaded.

### Background videos

`Config.media.videos` is a playlist of clips, one row each:

```lua
videos = {
    { video = 'media/intro.webm' },                              -- the video's own sound
    { video = 'media/city.webm', audio = 'media/theme.ogg' },    -- your audio over a video
    { image = 'media/hub.png', audio = 'media/voiceover.ogg' },  -- audio with a still image
    { image = 'media/logo.png', seconds = 5 },                   -- a silent image for 5 s
},
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `video` | A WebM (VP8/VP9) clip in `html/media/` or at an `https://` address. |
| `image` | A still or animated image instead of a video (ignored if `video` is set). |
| `audio` | Replaces the clip's sound: over a video it mutes the video's own track; with an image it plays alongside. mp3, ogg, wav, flac or webm (no m4a/AAC). |
| `seconds` | How long the clip runs. Default: a video's length; an image with audio runs for the length of its audio; an image without audio uses `slideSeconds`. A video shorter than `seconds` loops until the time is up. |

Every setting below is in `/config` under kora_loading and applies to players
who connect after you save (no restart needed):

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `videos` | `intro.webm` then nine 13 s scene clips | The rows above. Empty = no clips. |
| `videoSound` | `true` | Play each video's own soundtrack. Off plays them muted. A row's `audio` always plays either way. |
| `videoVolume` | `0.5` | Volume of video soundtracks and row audio (0–1). |
| `videoSoundButton` | `true` | Show a mute button (bottom right) while a clip can make sound. Each player's choice is remembered. |
| `videoOrder` | `'shuffle'` | `sequential` plays top to bottom and loops. `shuffle` plays each video once per round in a random order. `random` picks any video each time. Neither random mode plays the same video twice in a row. |
| `videoRandomStart` | `false` | With `sequential`, start each player at a random video, then continue in order. |
| `videoPinFirst` | `true` | The first video plays first on every load, once, as an intro; `videoOrder` then applies to the rest (with `shuffle`, reshuffled every load). A list of only the intro loops it. |
| `videoOverlap` | `0` | Seconds the next video fades in over the end of the current one. `0` is a clean back-to-back cut. Shortened automatically for clips too short to hold it. |
| `videoFadeIn` | `0.6` | Seconds the first video fades in over the background when the screen opens. |
| `videoMaxSeconds` | `0` | Move on after this many seconds even if the video is longer. `0` plays each to the end. |
| `videoSpeed` | `1` | Playback speed (0.25–2). |
| `videoFit` | `'cover'` | `cover` fills the screen (crops edges); `contain` shows the whole frame. |

Playback is gapless. The page keeps two stacked video layers: while one plays,
the other preloads the next clip. Shortly before the end it starts the next
clip and reveals it only once its first frame has been painted. The outgoing
clip stays on screen until then, so there is never a black frame, restart or
jump. A single video loops the same way, which is smoother than the browser's
built-in loop. A video that fails to load is skipped with a console warning.
If none load, the themed background shows.

Sound follows the picture: on a cut the next clip's sound starts as its first
frame appears, and on a crossfade the two sounds fade across each other. If the
game refuses to start sound on its own, the clip plays silently with the mute
button shown as muted, and the player's first click anywhere turns the sound
on. If the music player also has tracks, both are heard, so leave its tracks
empty when you use clip sound.

For the cleanest cuts, encode clips with a keyframe at the start (ffmpeg does
this by default) and keep them the same resolution. Small files matter: players
download them while connecting.

The settings reach the page as it opens: `server.lua` passes them over with
`deferrals.handover` while the player connects, read by the page as
`window.nuiHandoverData.kora_loading`. If that is missing (for example when
kora_loading was started after the player connected), the page shows built-in
defaults until the client script answers near the end of loading. A late
settings change never interrupts the clip on screen: the new list takes over at
the next hand-over.

### Music player

List one or more tracks and the screen shows a music player with the song
title, the artist, play/pause, skip, a volume slider and mute:
```lua
Config.musicPlayer = {
    enabled = true,
    volume = 0.3,
    tracks = {
        { title = 'Night Drive', artist = 'Kora Radio', url = 'media/night-drive.mp3' },
        { title = 'Static',      artist = 'Kora Radio', url = 'https://cdn.example.com/static.mp3' },
    },
}
```
- **With no tracks listed nothing is drawn**, so the player can stay enabled on
  a server that wants a silent loading screen.
- A `url` is a path inside `html/` or a full `https://` address, in any format
  FiveM's browser can decode: `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.flac` or `.webm`. It has
  no AAC or H.264 decoder, so `.m4a`/`.aac` and `.mp4` do not play (the same
  applies to `Config.media.videos`: convert them to WebM). A track that will not play is
  skipped; if none of them play, the panel hides itself.
- `title` and `artist` are optional — a track with no title is labelled with its
  file name.
- The volume and mute state a player picks are remembered for their next
  connect. `Config.musicPlayer.volume` only sets the starting point.
- Tracks play in order and loop back to the first. A single track loops in
  place.
- The controls are **mouse-only**: a loadscreen never gets keyboard focus. The
  cursor comes from `loadscreen_cursor 'yes'` in `fxmanifest.lua`, which is also
  what makes a mouse pointer visible while the screen is up.
- Browsers may refuse to start audio before the player has clicked something.
  When that happens the panel appears paused with a "press play" hint rather
  than silently failing.

`Config.media.music` still works: with the player enabled it becomes a
one-track playlist shown in the panel, and with `enabled = false` it keeps
playing silently with no panel at all, at `Config.media.musicVolume`.

### Matching your server's brand colour and fonts

The screen doesn't have its own colour or font config. A loadscreen is shown
before other resources are mounted, so `cfx-nui-kora_theme` may not answer yet.
The page therefore uses copies of kora_theme's `theme.js`, `theme.json` and
`fonts/` folder stored in `html/kora_theme/`, and the live kora_theme script
re-applies everything once it is reachable. After changing
`kora_theme/theme.json` — or after updating kora_theme itself — refresh the
copies:
```
node tools/sync-theme.mjs           # copy from kora_theme (found automatically)
node tools/sync-theme.mjs --check   # exit 1 if the copies are stale
```

Fonts follow kora_theme's `"fonts"` block (`heading`, `body`, `mono`) and the
`/config` font settings, exactly like every other Kora UI: the heading font is
used for the server name, the mono font for the `LOADING 42%` line, the body
font everywhere else. Because the font files are synced locally, the chosen font
renders from the first frame instead of only once kora_theme answers. Set
`Config.theme.fonts = false` to keep the plain built-in stack regardless of the
theme; colours always follow kora_theme either way.
Colours are set in one place, `kora_theme/theme.json` (not in Lua), then restart
`kora_theme`. Set the palette once and every kora_theme consumer picks it up
automatically:
```json
{
  "name": "Kora green",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#1E90FF"
  }
}
```
`name` is the label of the primary colour, and `presets` lists the extra colours
offered by the `/theme` picker. Players can also choose their own accent
colour in game with `/theme` (stored client-side; `/theme reset` returns to the
`theme.json` primary). See the kora_theme README for the full key list.

The loading page receives the current palette when it mounts; it does not keep
a Lua theme bridge alive after the loading frame shuts down.

## Customization

- **Server name / tips / progress text / wallpaper and media** —
  `Config.serverName`, `Config.tips`, `Config.showProgressText` and
  `Config.media` in `config.lua`.
- **Music player** — `Config.musicPlayer` in `config.lua`.
- **Accent colour, fonts and other theme tokens** — set in
  `kora_theme/theme.json`; players can override their own accent with `/theme`.
  `Config.theme.fonts` turns the theme font off for this screen only.
- **Layout/markup** — `html/index.html`, `html/style.css`, `html/app.js`.
  Bump the `?v=` query string on `style.css`/`app.js` when editing either, to
  bust FiveM's NUI (CEF) cache across reconnects.
